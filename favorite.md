I think my favorite text editor for this project is Nano, which is what I'm using 
to write this file. I like that it's easy to dive in because it's so lightweight
and you don't have to enter into any modes or buffers to just begin editing text.
The biggest plus for using this program for me is having the commands at the 
bottom of the screen. Since I'm at home with an infant right now, my short-term
memory is not working up to speed. So a lot of the time, I would have multiple 
tabs open with cheat sheets or Google searches to remind me of what the commands
are in each editor. With Nano, the most useful commands are right there in front
of me, so it took no time at all to complete the assignment using this program.

I can see how Emacs and Vi are useful in their own way because there are so many
other capabilities built in to the program. They seem to be a bit more robust.
Perhaps it was because I watched the Lynda course on Vi, but I feel more comfortable
with that program over Emacs. Once I got around buffers, and the different names
for well-known commands (delete/killing, yanking, putting instead of cut, copy, paste), 
and the modes in Vi, these editors felt more comfortable, but not quite as comfortable
as Nano. However, I think by the end of this assignment, I could get by if I needed
to use any one of the three to work in this sort of environment.
